# Project for the Web Developer course, by Software Academy from Sibiu.

## Benefit:
  - In order to have dynamic data in our future Angular application, we have to create in advance the backend application which works as a standalone application and can be used by many other applications

## Acceptance criteria:
  - A Node+Express+MongoDB application is created
  - The routes representing the CRUD operations are created
  - The routes are tested using POSTMAN
